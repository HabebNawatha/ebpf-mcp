## üß† AI-Ready Observability for Linux

`ebpf-mcp` is a lightweight MCP-compatible server that exposes **structured, AI-safe access to Linux kernel observability tools**, built on top of eBPF.

It wraps powerful tools like `bpftool` and the Cilium eBPF library into JSON-RPC endpoints that can be called by AI agents or CLI clients, enabling:

- ‚úÖ Safe eBPF program deployment (from disk or remote URL)
- ‚úÖ Structured inspection of attached kernel hooks
- ‚úÖ BPF map introspection
- ‚úÖ Error tracing of failing syscalls
- ‚úÖ Kernel capability discovery

---

## ‚úÖ What It Actually Delivers

These features are **implemented, tested, and available today**:

### üîç System Introspection

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/mcp -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": { "tool": "info", "input": {} }
}'
````

‚úî Detects kernel version, BTF support, cgroup v2
‚úî Returns structured JSON for AI agents to reason over

### üß™ Hook Inspection (bpftool wrapped in JSON)

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8080/mcp -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0", "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": { "tool": "hooks_inspect", "input": {} }
}'
```

Returns:

```json
{
  "programs": [
    {
      "id": 14,
      "type": "tracepoint",
      "name": "handle_syscall_error",
      "attached_to": "sys_enter",
      "pinned": false
    }
  ]
}
```

### üöÄ eBPF Deployment with Remote Support

```json
{
  "tool": "deploy",
  "args": {
    "program_path": "https://example.com/xdp_prog.o"
  }
}
```

‚úî Uses Cilium's Go library
‚úî Supports loading from URL or local path
‚úî Returns structured success or error output
‚úî Prints how many programs/maps were loaded

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Requirements

| Requirement         | Why It Matters                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Linux 5.8+**      | For modern eBPF support         |
| **BTF Enabled**     | Required for many bpftool ops   |
| **bpftool in PATH** | Used by inspection tools        |
| **cgroup v2**       | Required for some program types |
| **Clang/LLVM**      | Needed only if compiling `.c`   |

---

## üîê Security & Privilege Requirements

`ebpf-mcp` must run with sufficient privileges to interact with the kernel:

* ‚úÖ `CAP_BPF` and `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` usually required
* ‚úÖ XDP and tracepoints need elevated rights
* ‚ö†Ô∏è Always audit `.o` files before loading
* üß™ `deploy` validates programs via kernel verifier

---

## ‚ùå Failure Modes to Expect

| Condition               | Behavior                         |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Missing `bpftool`       | `hooks_inspect` fails gracefully |
| Invalid `.o` program    | `deploy` returns error via MCP   |
| Insufficient privileges | Kernel rejects program load      |
| No BTF support          | Some introspection may fail      |

---

## üì° MCP Protocol Support

| Feature       | Status     |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| `tools/list`  | ‚úÖ          |
| `tools/call`  | ‚úÖ          |
| `resources/*` | üöß Planned |
| Streaming     | üöß Planned |

---

## üîÆ Roadmap

> These are **not yet implemented**, but planned:

### üß† Claude / MCP Agent Integration

* Claude CLI can call `tools/call`, but doesn‚Äôt fully interpret streamed output yet
* Working on improved Claude and Ollama support via `ollama-chat` CLI
* MCP compliance is prioritized for LLM compatibility

### üß∞ Cursor AI (IDE Integration)

* We're exploring ways for Cursor AI to call local MCP endpoints (currently not supported natively)
* Early experiments with `ollama + ebpf-mcp` are promising for kernel debugging inside the dev environment

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sameehj/ebpf-mcp.git
cd ebpf-mcp
make build
sudo ./bin/ebpf-mcp-server -t http
```

Then call it using your favorite JSON-RPC client or the included [ollama-chat CLI](./cmd/ollama-chat).

---

## üîê Dual Licensing

`ebpf-mcp` uses a dual-license model to balance kernel compatibility with integration flexibility:

* üß¨ **GPL-2.0** for all code under `internal/ebpf/`  
  - Covers eBPF program loading and kernel-level interactions  
  - eBPF programs run in kernel space and may link with GPL-licensed kernel helpers  
  - Ensures compliance and compatibility with the Linux kernel and existing GPL eBPF code

* üß† **Apache-2.0** for all other components  
  - Covers the MCP server, protocol layer, tool registry, and client CLI  
  - Allows integration with proprietary or commercial AI agents, dev tools, and infrastructure  
  - Encourages broader adoption and contribution outside the kernel ecosystem

This model keeps kernel code legally compatible while enabling wide, flexible usage in AI-first systems and enterprise automation.

## üßô Join the eBPF Agent Army

We‚Äôre building the first structured agent layer over the Linux kernel ‚Äî and we need your help:

* ‚≠ê Star this repo
* üõ†Ô∏è Contribute a tool (`internal/tools/`)
* üß™ File bug reports or integration ideas
* ü§ñ Test it with LLMs and share feedback
